# Machine-Learning-Algorithms

## Task 1: Fundamentals of Machine Learning Algorithms

Covers Perceptron Learning, Linear Regression, and Logistic Regression through custom-developed algorithms, avoiding the use of built-in functions. This approach provides a deeper understanding of mathematics behind these algorithms.

- Please see the README in the task1 directory.

## Task 2: Advanced Machine Learning Techniques

Focuses on Support Vector Machines for binary and multi-class classification, k-Means Clustering, and Gaussian Mixture Models. This task delves into more complex machine learning techniques, including optimization of hyperparameters, and evaluation of model performance.

- Please see the README in the task2 directory.
